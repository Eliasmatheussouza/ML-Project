This project explores housing price prediction using machine learning techniques, leveraging both supervised and unsupervised learning models. The dataset, imported from a CSV file, includes various housing-related features such as location, size, and condition, which were preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling. For supervised learning, regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests were employed to predict housing prices. These models were evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), ensuring robust performance comparisons. In addition, classification techniques were applied to categorize houses into predefined price ranges, enabling insights into pricing segmentation.

Unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering using K-Means, were applied to identify patterns in the housing market. This revealed groupings of similar properties based on features such as size, number of rooms, and neighborhood attributes. Throughout the analysis, extensive use of Python libraries—Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn—allowed for efficient data manipulation, feature engineering, and visualization. The project highlights how machine learning can be applied to gain valuable insights into the housing market, enabling better decision-making for stakeholders.
